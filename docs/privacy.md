# Privacy Policy

**Last updated:** January 8, 2026

## Overview

Screenshotter is a utility app that allows you to capture screenshots on your Windows PC remotely from your iPhone. Your privacy is important to us, and this policy explains how we handle your information.

**The short version:** We don't collect, store, or share any of your data.

## Information Collection

Screenshotter does **not** collect any personal information or usage data. Specifically:

- **No analytics or tracking** — We do not use any analytics services or tracking tools
- **No account required** — You don't need to create an account or provide any personal information
- **No cloud services** — All communication happens directly between your devices over your local network
- **No data transmission** — No data is ever sent to us or any third parties

## How the App Works

Screenshotter operates entirely on your local network:

1. The Windows app displays a QR code containing your PC's local IP address
2. The iPhone app scans this QR code to establish a direct connection
3. Screenshots are captured on your Windows PC and transferred directly to your iPhone
4. Screenshots are saved to your iPhone's Photos library

All communication occurs exclusively over your local WiFi network. No data leaves your network or passes through any external servers.

## Permissions

The app requests the following permissions, used solely for core functionality:

| Permission | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| **Camera** (iOS) | To scan the QR code for pairing with your Windows PC |
| **Photo Library** (iOS) | To save captured screenshots to your Photos |
| **Local Network** (iOS) | To communicate with the Windows app on your network |

## Data Storage

- **iOS App:** Stores only the paired PC's local IP address using on-device storage (UserDefaults) for convenience when reconnecting
- **Windows App:** Does not store any persistent data

## Third-Party Services

Screenshotter does not integrate with any third-party services, SDKs, or APIs that collect user data.

## Children's Privacy

Screenshotter does not collect any personal information from anyone, including children under 13.

## Changes to This Policy

If we make changes to this privacy policy, we will update the "Last updated" date above. Continued use of the app after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.
